The player is presented with the option to choose between DEAL or NO DEAL. If the player chooses DEAL: The player predicts whether the value of the third card will fall between the values of the first two drawn cards. If the third card's value is between the first two, the player wins and earns money based on their bet. If not, the player loses their bet.
